In this folder are notebooks plus the needed files concerning the whole Internship. 
The notebooks are divided in 4 different projects:

1. `Clustersize_singletons`: a comparison of different datasets and their amount of singletons per clustersize,
2. `Many_vs_Single_clusters`: a comparison of swarm's computation parameters with one big cluster and lots of small clusters,
3. `effect_of_boundary_value`: the effect of swarm's `--boundary` option on computation and results,
4. `testing_swarm_options`: bash tests testing swarm's `--network` and `--fastidous`/`--boundary option`.

The notebooks describe the whole way how to get the data, plot and analyse it.
